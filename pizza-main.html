                <p class="pizzaInfo"><span>About...</span><br>"Pepperoni" ─ a spicy pizza 
                with the same name as the main ingredient - Italian salami. A lot of 
                peppers and spices, cheese and fragrant meat sausages are the main 
                components of the dish, which has gained popularity in all countries 
                of the world. In the U.S., pizza with spicy, searing toppings is in 
                particularly high demand, so many residents of the North American 
                continent consider this recipe to be on the list of national menus. 
                But, in fact, the homeland of pepperoni pizza, as well as many other 
                varieties of baked goods, is Italy. The main ingredients in the 
                original recipe for salami pepperoni were pork, herbs, and several 
                types of peppers. American sausages include three kinds of meat 
                (pork, beef, and chicken), hot Chilean peppers, Sicilian herbs, and 
                fragrant spices. It is no coincidence that pepperoni is used as the 
                main ingredient for "hot" pizza. Fans of spicy meat dishes will love 
                this recipe. The soft mozzarella cheese softens the searing spiciness 
                of the meat, giving the dish a certain spiciness. You can order pizza 
                "Pepperoni" with additional ingredients from the list presented on the 
                site: olives, jalapeño peppers and soft cheese are ideal for this recipe.

                A mouthwatering 4-meat pizza is one of the most popular dishes 
                ordered by fans of Italian cuisine. To make the pastries as delicious 
                as in the traditional pizzerias of Naples, you need to use the highest 
                quality and freshest products. The recipe includes chicken and beef meat,
                bacon and ham. Our chef carefully monitors the selection of ingredients 
                for baking, controlling the cooking process. The dough is soaked with the 
                juice of lightly fried meat, which, combined with warm creamy mozzarella 
                cheese, acquires a delightful taste. Fresh tomatoes and Bavarian sausages 
                complete the composition and give the dish a piquant zest. The choice of 
                sauce is at the discretion of the customer. Meat dishes are perfectly 
                combined with creamy and tomato compositions.

                <p class="pizzaInfo"><span>About...</span><br>
                    "Hawaiian" pizza is an original dish with a delicate, subtle 
                    flavour, given by juicy pineapple combined with tender meat. 
                    The recipe was created by Sam Panopoulos, a Canadian-born Greek. 
                    The product takes its name from the brand name of the canned 
                    pineapple used in pizzerias for toppings. Residents of the 
                    North American country were the first to try Hawaiian pizza 
                    and the dish quickly became a national trend. Hawaiian pizza 
                    is in particular demand among health-food lovers. The low-calorie,
                    easy-to-digest ingredients (mozzarella, chicken and pineapple) 
                    create a harmonious, sweet-and-sour flavour profile. Each 
                    pizzaiolo makes small modifications to the basic recipe, so 
                    there are many variations of this pizza around the world.

                <p class="howToCook"><span>STEP ONE</span><br>
                    Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating 
                    the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly 
                    with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.<br><br>
                    <span>STEP TWO</span><br>
                    To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust 
                    soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using 
                    your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to 
                    prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with pizza sauce, then 
                    add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon. <br><br>
                    <span>STEP THREE</span><br>
                    Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top 
                    with fresh basil, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve 
                    immediately. <br><br>
                    <span>STEP FOUR</span><br>
                    Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. 
                    Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up 
                    to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on 
                    freezing the pizza dough.

                <p class="pizzaInfo"><span>About...</span><br>
                    The history of pizza marinara goes back centuries. 
                    Originally it was a tomato sauce with garlic that fishermen 
                    took with them on long voyages. This tangy concoction has been 
                    around for a long time, adding variety to the fishermen's humble 
                    menus. The flatbread with the same name appeared much later, and 
                    in the first version it was a small crust with tomatoes, cottage 
                    cheese and oregano leaves. It's hard to say who came up with the 
                    idea of using seafood and fish for toppings, but the innovative 
                    recipe appealed to fishermen's families, and later to everyone 
                    who loves seafood. Modern pizzerias bake "Marinara" with squid, 
                    mussels, shrimp, soaking the crust with lots of cheese. It's a 
                    very wholesome meal that can't fail to delight gourmets. The 
                    flavour of an Italian dish depends directly on the ingredients. 
                    Only fresh (or freshly frozen) produce has the desired characteristics 
                    that determine the flavour of the food.

                    dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. Spread the 
                    pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create
                    a thin layer. Top with thinly sliced garlic. <br><br>

                    Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned,
                    about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven.
