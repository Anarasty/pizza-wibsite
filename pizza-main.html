            <p class="pizzaInfo"><span>Some story...</span><br>Italian immigration 
                into the US increased dramatically in the early 20th century, and these 
                immigrants began combining their southern European flavor traditions with 
                American ingredients. In 1919 we see the first mention of pepperoni 
                in the Italian-American delis of Lower Manhattan, though during the 
                First World War the word started being used among Italian-American 
                soldiers as a synonym for sausage. After the war, pepperoni began to 
                appear as a pizza topping, though still primarily in pizzerias in New 
                York City. Colin Caplan, author of New Haven Apizza, says that it 
                wasn’t until the mid-20th century that the real marriage of pizza 
                and pepperoni was celebrated. The first evidence he found of pepperoni 
                as a pizza topping came in 1950 from a photo of a wall menu at a pizzeria 
                named The Spot in New Haven, Connecticut. Since then it began to trickle 
                into toppings selections around the country.</p>

                <p class="howToCook"><span>STEP ONE</span><br>
                    Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine tomato sauce, Parmesan cheese 
                    and oregano in small bowl; spread tomato sauce evenly over crust. 
                    Sprinkle pizza with mozzarella cheese; top with pepperoni.<br><br>
                    <span>STEP TWO</span><br>
                    Place on ungreased pizza pan. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until 
                    edges of crust are browned lightly and cheese melts. Cut pizza 
                    into 6 slices.
